### Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```
---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure the correct Node.js version is installed. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions if necessary.
